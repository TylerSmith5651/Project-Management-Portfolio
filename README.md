# Project-Management-Portfolio
My professional career has always leaned towards leadership roles, starting all the way back in Middle School as a member of the Junior Leadership team at my local karate school, to now leading teams and inspiring amazing people as a professional career. 
In almost every aspect of my life, I am the person who takes action first and organizes relentlessly. In almost every single job i've ever held, I have been promoted to some sort of leadership role because of my natural tendency to micro manage and over think every single aspect of the job. 
As my career advances, I want to lead larger and larger teams of professionals to create amazing products and support amazing companies. Roles like Dev-Ops, Project Manager, and Creative Lead are what interest me, and I hope to see myself in those roles more and more as my career progresses. 
In this portfolio, I am recording a living repository of the projects that I am managing, and ones that I have managed in the past.
